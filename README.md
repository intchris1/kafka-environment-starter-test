## kafka-enrionment-starter-test
Starter library for testing.

Using Context Customizer, the library configures and starts three containers:

1) Kafka (default)
2) Schema Registry (optional, tied to Kafka)
3) Kafka UI (optional, binds to Kafka and/or SchemaRegistry)

Autoconfiguration is triggered by using the @EnableTestKafka annotation on a test class (or its superclass).
Annotations can be used to configure containers.
Spring.kafka.properties.schema.registry.url, spring.kafka.properties.bootstrap.servers and spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers will be automatically forwarded to containers environment.
If the container address is needed in another property, you can use @DynamicPropertySource and
static methods KafkaContainer#getBootstrapServers, SchemaRegistryContainer#getSchemaRegistryUrl in your test.

## REUSE OF CONTAINERS

EnableTestKafka#destroyContaintersAfterUse=false + Enable ~/.testcontainers.properties#testcontainers.reuse.enable=true

Ability to reuse containers - containers will not be destroyed after tests, which
allows you to run integration tests locally much faster.
To reuse containers, the hash of the created containers must be the same. The container hash is calculated
based on its start command.
The hash is not the same if the settings of the launched containers are different (for example, Kafka bootstrap servers for schema registry).
To get rid of this, constant network alias were added to the containers so that the container linking configuration
will be the same, and a reusable Network implementation has been added.
Whenever the configuration changes, the container test must check whether the containers are no longer reusable,
otherwise they will be created and re-run (there is validation for this).

EnableTestKafka#destroyContaintersAfterUse and EnableTestKafka#enableKafkaUi should only be used locally, before
you need to disable them by commit (so as not to waste resources and time in the pipeline).

## Container security customization
EnableTestKafka#enableKafkaSasl, EnableTestKafka#enableSchemaRegistryBasicAuth - ability to add security protocol
for the corresponding containers.
Login and password - admin: admin
When using sasl/basicAuth, the properties for consumer/producer in the ApplicationContext are not filled with the required values.
You need to write the correct configuration for your consumer/producer, you can use ./resources/application-testfull.yml as an example
There is also ./resources/application-testbyte.yml - if you donâ€™t need anything other than unprotected Kafka.

## Test accessor
By default, a KafkaContainerTestAccessor bean is created in the context (available for @Autowired) - allows you to read and
send messages to the Kafka container.
If Schema Registry is used, KafkaAvroDeserializer/Serializer is used, otherwise ByteArrayDeserializer/Serializer (that is, a byte[] object is returned)

It is possible to connect KafkaUi to a remote SchemaRegistry using KafkaUiContainer#withRemoteSchemaRegistry.
